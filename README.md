#Test Driven Development Using Jasmine 2.2
This small repo was built concurrently when taking the Udacity Class (ud549) on Test Driven Development. Find an overview to that course here: (https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549-nd)

#Red --> Green Refactoring
Using simple Jasmine syntax 3 expectations were put forth. As this was built using test-driven development, initially all these tests failed.

Then using object oriented code one-by-one the errors were changed to be in line with expectation.

This now outlines very essential basics for building an Address Book application

#See All Green!
To see that all 3 tests pass, clone the repo onto your local machine and then open the SpecRunner.html file
